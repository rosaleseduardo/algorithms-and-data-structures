# What is the Big O?

Metric used in Software Engineering to measure the efficiency of our algorithms. It is essential for determining how our algorithms will perform under a high workload.

Time is not the only important factor when analyzing an algorithm. The amount of memory used can also be highly relevant. Typically, trade-offs are made between time complexity and space complexity, as improving one often leads to worsening the other.

Therefore, the goal is to find a good balance between the two complexities and choose the one that best suits our needs, given our specific conditions.
